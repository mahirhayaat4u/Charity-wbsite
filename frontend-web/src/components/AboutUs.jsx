          Our commitment extends to empowering those with visual, hearing, and speech impairments through life skills training and specialised education. Additionally, we provide professional skill development programs for people with disabilities. Established in 1985, Narayan Seva Sansthan had a humble beginning as the charity foundation, â€˜A Fistful of Flour', serving meals to the physically and economically disadvantaged. Our mission has since evolved. Today, we offer free corrective surgeries to patients suffering from polio and congenital disabilities. We also provide free artificial limbs to amputees.

          Our headquarters are situated in Udaipur, Rajasthan, India, where our hospital boasts a collective capacity of 1100 beds and attracts patients from across India and the world for polio-related treatments and corrective surgeries. Regardless of caste, creed, or religion, we have conducted over 4,38,453 free-of-cost polio corrective surgeries to date. We continue to transform lives, aiming to be considered the top charity organisation in India that serves those in need, consistently working towards the betterment of society as a whole.
